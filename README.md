# Akwilit Trade Logger

## What it does
This is a project I’m working on. The goal is to build a tool that helps traders log their crypto trades.
- Write down pair, entry, exit, profit/loss, and notes
- Show all trades in a dashboard
- Connect wallet (MetaMask) in future updates

## Why I’m building it
I’m a forex trader learning Web3. This project combines my trading experience with blockchain technology.

## Status
Work in progress — not yet deployed.

## Next Steps
- Build the frontend (React / Next.js)
- Connect to database or smart contract
- Deploy live version
